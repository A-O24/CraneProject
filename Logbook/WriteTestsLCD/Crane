Write four tests for your project to verify it does what it was supposed to do.
How? Pick your own style: automatic, manual, Given-When-Then, Behavior-driven, etc. Do some research and find ways to objectively verify the correctness of your design. Select what works best for your project.
Where to start? Check your project definition. It will tell you what you wanted to achieve.
This is an individual assignment. You should each have your own answers, not copied from others.
Test 1:
Given: An LCD screen being used
When: a controller is being connected
Then: The bluetooth logo appears to demonstrate device pairing.


Test 2:
Given: The controller to function the crane
When: Inputting double up or down
Then: It’ll switch between servos and keep the original position / saved position.


Test 3:
Given: The LCD screen is visible to the user
When: Switching between servos / 
Then: LCD will output servo number in correspondence to which one is being controlled. (Will be mentioned in user manual / explained more)



Test 4:
Given: The STL file to create / make the crane’s structure
When: 3D printing / making sure measurements are true to size in order to make sure the servos fit.
Then: we will proceed to assemble the crane with screws/ make our prototype.


Test 5:
Given: The Controller used to pinch and close the crane
When: Turning the joystick clockwise or counterclockwise
Then: The crane’s claw will close and open in response to the direction.
